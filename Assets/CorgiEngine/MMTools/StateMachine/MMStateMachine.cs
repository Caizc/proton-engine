	/// To use it, you need an enum. For example : public enum CharacterConditions { Normal, ControlledMovement, Frozen, Paused, Dead }
	/// Declare it like so : public StateMachine<CharacterConditions> ConditionStateMachine;
	/// Initialize it like that : ConditionStateMachine = new StateMachine<CharacterConditions>();
	/// Then from anywhere, all you need to do is update its state when needed, like that for example : ConditionStateMachine.ChangeState(CharacterConditions.Dead);
	/// The state machine will store for you its current and previous state, accessible at all times, and will also optionnally trigger events on enter/exit of these states.
	/// You can go further by using a StateMachineProcessor class, to trigger more events (see the list below).
